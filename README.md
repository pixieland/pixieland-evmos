# Welcome to Pixieland
## Pixieland empowers gamers with a metaversal play to earn game using  dynamic digital assets with a cross chain marketplace 
 
## Inspiration
There is currently no marketplace for dynamic digital assets with cross chain functionality.

## What it does
Pixieland empowers gamers with a metaversal play to earn game using  dynamic digital assets with a cross chain marketplace 

## How we built it
We built our front end using react, react spring, solidity and nodejs.

## Challenges we ran into
Most of the challenges we experienced dealt with integrating the front end with the back end, creating the gaming aspect but are proud to come up with a live application

## What we learned
We learned the value of teamwork and the hard technical skills of solidity as well as how to integrate the front and back end. Because of the diversity of the teams skill set, we were also able to share our experience to come up with a great application.

## What's next for 
Next for Pixieland is to deploy on mainnet and make a better game mechanism. Fix the UI and make the pixies 3 dimensional as opposed to 2D.
